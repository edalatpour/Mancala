# Mancala

A modern rendition of the classic board game Mancala, or Kalah.

The object of the game is to collect as many stones as possible before your opponent clears their side of the board. The rules of the game are simple:

1. The board is made up of two rows of six “cups” each.
2. Four “stones” are placed in each of the 12 cups.
3. Each player has a “home cup” to the right side of the cups.
4. On your move, tap one of the cups on your side of the board to pick up all the stones from that cup.
5. Moving counter-clockwise, one stone is deposited in each cup (including your own home cup) until the stones run out.
6. If the last stone lands in an empty cup on your side of the board, you capture that stone and any stones in the cup directly opposite, and place them in your home cup
7. If the last stone lands in your home cup, you get an extra move.
8. Play alternates until all six cups on one side of the board are empty. Whoever has the most stones in their home cup wins the game.
