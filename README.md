# Mancala

A modern rendition of the classic board game Mancala, or Kalah.

The object of the game is to collect as many stones as possible before your opponent clears their side of the board.

Version 1.1 adds a trial mode, allowing you to play up to 5 games before purchasing. You can download Mancala by clicking on this link if you have the Zune software installed: http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=58cf5831-ecda-df11-a844-00237de2db9e.
